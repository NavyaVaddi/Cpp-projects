A simple C++ program which validates credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm.

The Luhn algorithm, also known as the modulus 10 or mod 10 algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers. 
The LUHN formula was created in the late 1960s by a group of mathematicians. 
Shortly thereafter, credit card companies adopted it. Because the algorithm is in the public domain, it can be used by anyone. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers. It was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks.
